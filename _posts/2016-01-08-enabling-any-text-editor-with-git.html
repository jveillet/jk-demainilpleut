<p>I'm joining the party a little late, but I've started working with <code>git</code> and <code>GitHub</code>, both for this website, and coincidentally at work for my current project.This is a quick article about using your favorite editor to write your commit messages.</p>

<h2>State of the art</h2>
<p>If you happen to work with <code>git</code> (if not, you should download and it and play with it, it's marvelous), you probably need to enter a commit message at some point. When you first setup your environment, no default editor is configured (on OSX, if <code>git</code> is installed with XCode, it might use <code>vim</code> as the default editor).</p>

<p>Checking out what is configured, it is as easy as invoking this line in the Terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ git config core.editor
vim
</code></pre>
<p>Chances are, you will get an empty line as nothing is probably set.</p>

<h2>Change the editor</h2>
<p>Let's say you want to use SublimeText 3. This software comes with a very handy multiplatform (Windows and OSX) CLI call <code>subl</code>, that you can invoke in the Terminal. To use it anywhere in your command line, you either have to put the path of the executable into the <code>PATH</code> variable of the Windows environment, or do a symlink on OSX (see Resources).</p>

<p>Open up a Terminal then type <code>subl</code>, you should see that it will open a new Sublime window. There is a bunch of optional parameters that you can pass to interact with Sublime, like <code>-n</code> for opening up a new window, or <code>-w</code> to wait for the files to be closed before returning.</p>

<p>To change the editor settings, use this command in the Terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
$ git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"
</code></pre>

<p>Now every time the command <code>git commit</code> will be invoked, SublimeText will be the default editor for commit messages.</p>
